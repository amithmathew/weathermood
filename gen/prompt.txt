"Create an idyllic scene of a countryside at dusk where the warm glow of the sun has just set and the clear blue sky is gradually giving way to twinkling stars. Show the rolling hills and fields lush with crops, surrounded by tall trees providing a natural canopy. The landscape is peaceful and still but not silent; the gentle chirping of crickets and the occasional rustling of foliage can be heard in the distance. In the foreground, a small creek babbles over smooth stones. Capture the essence of a calm summer evening where nature takes center stage and the beauty of the world shines under a clear and starry sky."
