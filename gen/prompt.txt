"Create a whimsical landscape scene reminiscent of a Miyazaki film, set during the daytime in Mostly Cloudy and Light Snow weather. The scene should evoke feelings of warmth, comfort, and coziness. The focal point of the artwork should be the natural surroundings, with elements like rolling hills, towering trees, and quaint structures that seamlessly blend into the environment. This artwork should capture the peaceful and serene feeling of winter landscapes without focusing on any creatures or people."
