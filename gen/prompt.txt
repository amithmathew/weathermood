Create an enchanted winter wonderland scene with a whimsical feel, featuring a picture-perfect landscape complete with snow-capped mountains and cozy cottages. Be sure to incorporate hues of blue, purple and pink to accentuate the mostly cloudy and light snow weather conditions. Your artwork should feel like a scene straight out of a Miyazaki film â€“ charming, magical and brimming with warmth.
