Show me a magical landscape with rolling hills covered in a thick layer of soft, green moss that seems to light up at night under a cloudy sky. The trees in this landscape are tall and slender, with leaves that are glistening with dewdrops. In the distance, there is a waterfall cascading down the rocks, creating a soothing sound that is amplified by the stillness of the night. The landscape is dotted with twinkling fireflies which seem to follow a hidden path. The overall feeling is one of peacefulness, comfort, and coziness that could only be found in the imagination of Miyazaki.
