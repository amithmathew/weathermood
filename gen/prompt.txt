"DALL-E, create a Miyazaki-style cartoon of a cozy and ethereal landscape, encompassed by dense mist and clouds. The scene should take place at night, illuminated by the soft glow of the crescent moon. There should be no signs of human or animal life, yet the landscape should be teeming with lush greenery, cascading waterfalls, and sparkling streams. Make the weather the focal point of the image, exuding a certain sense of serenity and tranquility."
