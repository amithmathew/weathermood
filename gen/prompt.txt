Create a whimsical, storybook-inspired landscape featuring a picturesque village nestled in a lush, rolling countryside. Set amidst soft, wispy clouds illuminated by the gentle glow of a full moon, this scene should evoke feelings of warmth, comfort, and tranquility. Pay close attention to small details that make the image feel alive, such as twinkling stars, flickering candlelight in windows, or the sound of rustling leaves in the breeze. Avoid any direct references to characters or creatures, as the focus should be on the beauty of the landscape itself. Let the charm and magic of this setting shine through in every detail.
