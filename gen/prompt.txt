"Create a magical scene inspired by the beloved films of Hayao Miyazaki, set in a breathtaking landscape that exudes warmth and comfort. With a focus on the beauty of the night sky, bring to life a serene and peaceful atmosphere as if you were sitting in a garden under a starry, clear and sunny sky. The landscape should be inviting and soothing, with rich colors and textures that evoke a sense of tranquility in the viewer. Avoid any living beings in the scene, and instead, let the natural beauty of the night and the earth take center stage."
