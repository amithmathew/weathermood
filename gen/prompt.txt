Create a miyazaki style cartoon painting of a peaceful forest clearing on a cloudy night, where a gentle rain is falling and soft mist is rising from the ground. Show the forest foliage aglow with the light of fireflies, and include a winding stream or brook. The clearing should feature a lone cabin, warmly lit from within, with a faint curl of smoke rising from the chimney.
