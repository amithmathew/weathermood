"Create a whimsical world that appears to be straight out of a Miyazaki film, complete with rolling hills, charming little houses, and a babbling brook. The scene should be basked in the warm glow of a sunny day with clear, blue skies overhead. Think tranquil and idyllic, with every detail adding to the overall sense of peace and contentment."
