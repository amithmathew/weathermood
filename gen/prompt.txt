Create a whimsical scene of a peaceful countryside bathed in brilliant sunlight, where the gentle breeze carries the sweet scent of freshly bloomed flowers. Your landscape should feature quaint, charming cottages with thatched roofs, nestled amongst rolling green hills and fields of wheat. The sky should be a vibrant shade of blue, with wispy cotton clouds drifting lazily by. Your art should evoke a sense of tranquility and warmth, inviting the observer to bask in the natural beauty of a perfect summer day.
