"Create a whimsical scene of a quaint village under a starry sky, surrounded by rolling hills and lush meadows, with warm glowing windows and charming cottages. The sun has long set, but the sky remains clear and crisp, with a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the trees. The landscape should evoke a sense of calm and tranquility, with no other signs of life besides the occasional flicker of a distant light. Show the beauty and wonder of a clear, sunny night in the countryside, filled with magic and possibility."
