Create a whimsical scene of rolling hills surrounded by tall trees under a cloudy, moonlit sky. The warm glow of lanterns and string lights illuminates the area, casting a soft and inviting ambiance. Include small details like comfortable-looking benches and cozy blankets draped over them. Add a touch of magic by incorporating fireflies dancing around the trees.
