"Create an idyllic world where the sky is a soft shade of gray, scattered clouds provide just enough shade, and the sun's gentle rays peek through. The landscape should evoke feelings of warmth and comfort, with rolling hills and trees in the distance. Make it seem like a perfect outdoor sanctuary. There should be no people or creatures present, just the beauty of nature in its simplest form."
