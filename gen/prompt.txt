"Create an idyllic, tranquil setting that would inspire any artist to take out their sketchbook. The scene should be reminiscent of a Miyazaki film, complete with pastel colors and charming details. The landscape should be cozy, comfortable and beautiful, with a misty and cloudy weather that sets the mood. Whether it's a lush meadow, a winding river or a mountaintop retreat, the setting should evoke feelings of peace and relaxation. Without any presence of people or creatures, let the serene surroundings be the focal point of the creation."
