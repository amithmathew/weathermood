Please create a visually stunning landscape with a warm and welcoming ambiance, inspired by the whimsical art of Miyazaki. The setting should have a night-time feel with cloudy weather adding to the overall cozy atmosphere. Avoid depicting people or creatures, instead focusing on the elements of the environment such as flowing streams, towering trees, and misty mountain ranges. Let the weather take center stage by conveying the mood and atmosphere through the use of lighting and color. Bring the scene to life by adding details such as flickering fireflies, twinkling stars, and rolling fog.
