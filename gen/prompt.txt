Create a scene that captures the serene beauty of a nighttime landscape during light rain, reminiscent of the enchanting worlds illustrated by one of Japan's greatest animators. The landscape should evoke a sense of coziness and comfort, with softly lit trees casting gentle shadows across the wet pavement below. Let the colors be muted and moody, but warm, with hints of blues and greens contrasted by the soft orange glow of street lamps in the distance. Make sure the rain is depicted in detail, with raindrops hitting the surface of the pavement, and the slight ripples they create. The overall effect should remind us of how peaceful and invigorating it can be to experience the serenity of nature while seeking refuge from the elements.
