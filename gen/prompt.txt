"Create a dreamy scene of a peaceful nighttime landscape with warm, soft lighting and a hint of mystery. The weather should be clear and sunny, with a sparkling starry sky overhead. The scene should evoke a feeling of comfort and coziness, as though we are peeking through a window into a magical world. Include features such as a winding creek or river, rolling hills, and towering trees with gently rustling leaves. The landscape can be either realistic or fantastical, but should be reminiscent of the breathtaking scenery found in the animated films of Hayao Miyazaki. "
