Create a whimsical winter wonderland with a Japanese twist. Depict a serene landscape bathed in a soft, bluish-purple moonlight. Show snowflakes lightly falling from the sky, almost as if dancing in the air. The trees should be evergreens with snow weighing down the branches and a light fog hovering around them. There should be a small cottage or temple made of dark wood with a winding path leading up to it. The roof is sloped with snow on top and there is a small smokestack with light smoke rising from it. The landscape is mostly cloudy, but there is a break in the clouds allowing the moon and snowflakes to peek through. Bring magic to this nighttime cartoon with a sense of peaceful stillness, as though time has stopped in this serene landscape.
