"Create a captivating and enchanting scene of a serene landscape straight out of a Miyazaki film: picture a picturesque countryside surrounded by rolling hills and lush green meadows. The focus should be on the weather, with billowy clouds seamlessly filling the sky, casting a soft, diffused light across the entire scene. Capture the magic of a cozy, peaceful daytime ambiance that invites viewers to immerse themselves in the tranquility of this idyllic setting. Avoid any reference to living beings, directing attention solely to the sublime weather and inviting a sense of wonder and calm."
