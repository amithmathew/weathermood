Create an idyllic landscape that would be home to all sorts of magical and mystical creatures alike. Your artwork should be inspired by the beloved films of Hayao Miyazaki, and should depict a cozy, comfortable and beautiful landscape, where the weather is Light Rain and it is nighttime. Captivate us with a landscape that conjures a sense of wonder and tranquillity, where the gentle pattering of raindrops fills the air and the stars twinkle like jewels in the sky. Without any people or creatures present, the artwork should take the viewer on a journey of serenity and peace, soaking in the beauty of nature's canvas.
