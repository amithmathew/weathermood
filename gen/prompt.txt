Create an ethereal, dream-like world where the clouds hang low and the moon casts a soft glow on rolling hills, trees, and fields. The landscape should feel cozy and inviting, full of little details that make it feel lived in and loved. Hints of magic or whimsy are welcome, but keep the focus on the weather and the natural beauty of the scene.
