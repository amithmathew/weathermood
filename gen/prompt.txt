Can you create an image of a peaceful, Miyazaki-inspired landscape at nighttime? The scene should feel cozy and comfortable, with warm lights glowing through windows and a sense of tranquility emanating from the surroundings. The weather is clear and sunny, with a sky full of stars overhead. The landscape should be full of detail and texture, with winding paths, towering trees, and gently rolling hills. Your image should evoke a feeling of serenity and calmness, offering a respite from the chaos of the day and a chance to simply enjoy the beauty of the world around us.
