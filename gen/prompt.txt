"Create an inviting Miyazaki-inspired landscape with a warm, cozy atmosphere that evokes feelings of comfort and peace. The setting should feature a radiant sun setting on the horizon, casting a warm orange and yellow glow across the sky. Add lush greenery and trees with gentle, swaying branches. The air should be perfect, with a light breeze that caresses the leaves and carries the sweet scent of flowers. The night should be serene and clear, accentuated by a soothing display of stars and a crescent moon. Let the landscape radiate with positivity and warmth, as if it's inviting the viewer in for a moment of peace and relaxation."
