Create a dreamy, peaceful scene that captures the beauty of a summer night. The landscape should be filled with lush greenery and blooming flowers, illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. Imagine a small stream winding through the landscape, reflecting the twinkling stars above. The weather is perfect; clear skies, warm breezes, and a gentle rustling in the leaves. Your goal is to create a serene and tranquil setting that invites viewers to relax and let their worries fade away.
